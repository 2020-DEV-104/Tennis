- [Legacy-support-v4](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library) - To use APIs that are either not available for older platform versions or utility APIs that aren't a part of the framework APIs.
    
- [Lifecycle-viewmodel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - To use the the ViewModel class which is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way
    
- [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) - To create a Single Activity App and handle fragment transactions defined in a graph.
